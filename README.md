# BookShelf 
BookShelf is an application that allows users to log books and sort them into personal lists such as to read, currently reading, and completed. 

Users also have access to the books created by others users, and can browse books by genre.

Users can click summary/review links to access a page with a books summary. On this page users can leave reviews on books.

Users are able to edit/delete any post they have made.

Admins are able to edit/delete all posts including both books and reviews. 

## Why this app? 

I made this app because I wanted to motivate myself to read more, and I like tools that help people stay organized.

## in the future...

In a second version of this app, I would add a keyword search to the list of all books. 
I would also allow users to view the books in order of best rated to worst rated.
